Install
=======
To install the SOTPAL Discord bot, clone the source code from the GitHub
repository and change into the directory made:

	git clone https://github.com/fearlessdoggo21/sotpal
	cd sotpal

After Go has been installed, you can build and run the bot all in one command.
Note that the Discord bot token is handled by a command line argument:

	go run main.go [TOKEN]


Configuration
-------------
Some strings, such as those containing the roles used by SOTPAL to determine
privilege ("SOTPAL Trusted", "SOTPAL Untrusted"), are unique throughout the
entire source code and repository in general. To change these, a simple search
and replace command would suffice:

	sed 's/SOTPAL Trusted/Trusted Role/g' *.go
	sed 's/SOTPAL Untrusted/Untrusted Role/g' *.go

Alternatively, the source code is designed to be very simple and
straightforward with descriptions for each function in docs/. Therefore,
editing the source code to slightly configure it is not out of the question. It
is expected that any additional logging be added this way.
